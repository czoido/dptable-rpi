#### daft punk table control and server for raspberry pi ####

This are the sources for the Daft Punk Table control as seen on my youtube channel: [http://www.youtube.com/user/mrgalleta76](http://www.youtube.com/user/mrgalleta76)

The program calculates the Fast Fourier Transform to sync with the music beat.

It also runs a server in order to accept petitions from a client (in this case I'm controlling it through an Iphone App).

It has not much comments and it can be significantly improved, I coded it very fast. Sorry for that!. I hope that this will be useful for someone.
