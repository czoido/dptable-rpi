#### daft punk table control and server for raspberry pi ####

This are the sources for the Daft Punk Table control as seen on my youtube channel:

[![Daft Punk Table controlled by iPhone](http://img.youtube.com/vi/-8JwFZPOqj8/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8JwFZPOqj8)

The program calculates the Fast Fourier Transform to sync with the music beat.

It also runs a server in order to accept petitions from a client (in this case I'm controlling it through an Iphone App).

It has not much comments and it can be significantly improved, I coded it very fast. Sorry for that!. I hope that this will be useful for someone.
